It is unclear if the sleep duration of New Yorkers follow normal distribution, but likely it could be. One way to check is to plot a histgram of the 25 sampled New Yorker to see if it is bell shape and symemtric. if so, then a size of 25 would be likely sufficient for CLT, therefore, we can assume normal distribution of the sampling distribution and use it to evaluate hypothesis test and construct confidence interval.  \n",
